# Flight-Center-Data-Analysis
We analyzed the data provided by the Durham Flight Center along with external data obtained from credible sources to create a report answering questions related to efficiency and scheduling.
The project is a result of joint efforts put in by the Collaborators as mentioned in the final report.

## Analysis Plan
With the data given and additional data on monthly air traffic, weather and seasons, the following questions
will be adressed by our analysis:
### How can scheduling be made the most efficient? 
We plan to suggest ways to enhance the quality and efficiency of scheduling training sessions by gauging patterns in the efficiency of instructors, duration between
two sessions, the density of student enrollment every month, and student performance per season. The
efficiency of instructors is assessed based on the average number of exercises students completed while being
trained by each instructor. The density of student enrollment was estimated using the number of sessions that
took place per month. The student performance was calculated based on the number of exercises completed
by a student in a given time frame per session. All of these metrics indicate patterns that could help us
increase the efficiency of scheduling sessions. Above results could also be used to optimize the recruitment of
instructors with regards to the density of sessions per season.

### What are the optimal conditions for student success? 
Our goal is to identify the conditions during training sessions that impact and, in turn, lead to student success. 
We consider a milestone like the first solo flight of the student as the factor expressing student training success. 
We account for a diverse array of metrics such as the number of exercises per hour of training, the weather and seasons during training sessions,
the change in student performance for each instructor, the number of sessions required for the student to
complete a milestone, most efficient training type, duration of particular exercises like dual flights, completion
of a common set of exercises, comparison of students who didnâ€™t achieve particular milestones, etc.
In summary, our analysis plan is dependent on determining correlations between multiple important and
controllable factors in the training process. We will do this by using data analysis tools such as graphs and
linear regression to determine whether one factor of the training process impacts performance and if so, what
the impact of that factor is.
